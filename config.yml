# It is assumed that the CloudSQL instance we use to store data is in the same project

# CLOUDSQL_REGION identifies the geographical region of the CloudSQL instance.
# This is selected at the time of instance creation.
CLOUDSQL_REGION: us-east1

# CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE_ID identifies an instance of Google Cloud SQL, which should be viewable at
# https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances.  The left-most column is the instance id.

# CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME:
# An instance's connection name can be viewed in the Overview tab of the "Instance details" page.
# It is concatenation of $PROJECT_ID:$CLOUDSQL_REGION:$CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE_ID, separated by colons.
# If this property is not defined in this yml file, then it will be formed by concatenating the
# three properties defined above.
# If this property is defined, then no need to define CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE_ID, and CLOUDSQL_REGION.
# CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME: keep-ahope:us-east1:ahope-postgres-dev

# DATABASE_CREDENTIALS is the CloudSQL database user and the password, separated by a colon.
# This property is mandatory unless DATABASE_URI is defined (which includes it)
DATABASE_CREDENTIALS: postgres:ahopepostgres

# DATABASE_NAME is the name of the database inside a CloudSQL instance.  A CloudSQL instance is just an instance
# of PostgreSQL server, which is capable of hosting multiple databases inside it, and hence a database name
# is needed to identify the database to use.
# This property is mandatory unless DATABASE_URI is defined (which includes it)
DATABASE_NAME: ahope

# DATABASE_URI, when undefined here, is formed as 
#   postgres://$DATABASE_CREDENTIALS@/cloudsql/$CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME/$DATABASE_NAME

# DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE defines the connection pool size used by Parse Server, which should not exceed
# what's given in the PostgreSQL section in https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#fixed-limits, based on
# the amount of RAM configured to the SQL instance.  
#
# Note the foot note there:
#
#    Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL reserves up to six of these connections for internal operations.
#
# PostgreSQL reserves a few (by default 3) connections for the superuser. See
#   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-SUPERUSER-RESERVED-CONNECTIONS
#
# In addition, in the "App Engine Limits" section in https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas
# Each App Engine instance running in a standard environment cannot have more than 100 concurrent connections
# Therefore, make sure this limit is observed as well.
#
DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE: 16
